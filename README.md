This is a forum Project created with React, React Router, and Redux!  It is a website where users can create an account and create posts to join all types of football-related discussion.
 
Users can create an account and then post to their favorite topic.  You can choose from general discussion, your favorite team, or players.  Post history and count is stored in your profile along with a profile image.  

This was a great learning experience using React and functional components, along with managing state.  It was tough to figure out as I was using Firebase to store all user posts and data, before I learned what SQL is.  This would have been a lot easier with SQL tables and relationships.
